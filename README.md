# 🧑🏾‍💻My First Java Project

This project was created with the goal of putting into practice my knowledge in the Java programming language.

## 🏗️Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to keep sources
- `edu.deyvisson this directory is intended to store the contents learned during the weeks
- `lib`: the folder to keep dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

<!-- > If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.-->

## Dependency Management

<!--The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).-->

I plan to use the springboot framework soon in this same project.
